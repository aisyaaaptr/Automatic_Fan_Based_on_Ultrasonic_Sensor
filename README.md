# Automatic Fan Based on Ultrasonic Sensor
This project aims to make an automatic fan based on ultrasonic sensor. The way it works is that the farther the detected distance, the faster the wind will be. And the closer the detected object, the slower the wind will be.

## Tools
- Arduino Uno
- Sensor Ultrasonic
- Fan
- Adaptor
- Jumper
- Bread Board
- Arduino IDE

## Goals
The aim of this project is to develop an Ultrasonic Sensor Based Automatic Fan that adjusts its speed dynamically based on the distance of the object. By increasing the wind speed as the detected object moves further away and decreasing it as the object approaches, the system aims to provide efficient and responsive cooling, improving user comfort and energy efficiency.

## Step 1: Requirement Analysis
- Define system functionality:
  - The fan’s speed increases as the distance to the detected object increases.
  - The fan’s speed decreases as the object moves closer.
- Identify environmental conditions, such as the typical distance range for detection and power requirements.
- Specify hardware and software needs, including the ultrasonic sensor, fan, and control unit.

## Step 2: System Design
- Create a wiring schematic to connect the ultrasonic sensor, microcontroller, and fan.
- Ensure the setup is compact, safe, and easy to mount.

## Step 3: Prototyping
- Assemble the components according to the design.
- Test basic functionality to ensure the ultrasonic sensor accurately detects distances and the fan speed adjusts accordingly.
